# CETL-MSOR 2022 Beyond alt text: Creating explorable objects in place of images in digital resources. {-}

The digital resources used to support students at university are required to be accessible. This includes any images they may contain. If a picture tells 1,000 words then writing alt text for the 1,000+ images on mathcentre, the post-16 maths resource sharing website, is going to take quite a while. However there is an alternative - convert these images to explorable accessible digital objects. A screen reader can do the heavy lifting for the words, and all students will benefit from an interactive resource. 

A team from the University of Bath and Coventry University have been working together to explore the conversion of images to digital objects. This session will cover what the teams have learned, based on the objectives of the project. 

The session will aim to: 

- Offer guidance on how to use the digital tools Desmos and Geogebra to create digital objects in place of images, and share insight on which is best to convert different types of images. 
- Expose the size of the conversion task for the resources on the mathcentre website. 
- Set out a framework to allow the maths support community to collaborate on the mathcentre image conversion task.

# Listen to the problem

It's useful to get an understanding of what your resources are like when *viewed* with a screen reader. It's very straight forward to get a simple screen reader going on google chrome, you can then try out your resources. Emma Cliffe has made this useful resource to get going: [Getting started with with a simple screen reader.](https://people.bath.ac.uk/cspehj/coventry/arclengthInR.html)

## Desmos audio trace

When you are in the equation window on the side of the Desmos graphing calculator pres `alt` and `t` to get screen reader menu. You can then click 'hear graph' to get an audio representation of the graph. The [accessibility notes for Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/accessibility) will tell you more about this feature. 

Can you identify which graph is being played via the Desmos audio trace?

# Guiding Principles

## Maps not directions

Navigating from A to B, if you're go wrong on a set of directions your lost. However, if you have a map you've got a chance to find your way again. 

Creating an explorable digital object rather than writing alt text gives the user the opportunity to build a map of the image themselves, rather than rely on someone else's interpretation.

Example: Geometric diagram.

![Image of right angled triangle](./Final Report_img/media/image4.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.2381944444444444in"}

Creating a digital interactive geometric diagram allows the user to move between points themsleves and findout what is connected to what. 

## Simplify

> Our life is frittered away by detail... simplify, simplify.
>
> *Henry David Thoreau*

Personally I think one simplify would have done, but hey! Screen readers are verbose. Reducing screen clutter makes for a more pleasant experience. Some embleshments to diagrams that are neccessary when they are static pictures become obsolite once they become interactive. Take for example arrows to show movement. Once movement is possible is the arrow necessary. The best replacement for an image may not look 100% like the original image.

For example the arrows on this image.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image10.png){width="3.192361111111111in"
height="2.647222222222222in"}

Once the object becomes interactive the arrows become irrelavent since the user can move the object themselves.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/qqq2vrjp/width/1920/height/961/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false", height="300px")
```

## The wheel is already invented

Where possible use the in built functionality of the software being used to make digital objects. 

To recreate the tick marks on the following image, three extra points would have to be added to the dirgram. This makes more clutter for a screen reader user.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image1.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.6631944444444446in"}

Using the *baked in* functionality of the software adds some extra tick marks but creates a much cleaner experience.

# Desmos useful techniques

Here are some useful techniques when using Desmos.

## Removing clutter

By selecting a few options in Desmos you can create really nice looking diagrams.

### $y = sin(x)$ with no formating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qq0fjs6jvd")
```

This is was made by just entering the equation $y = sin(x)$ into Desmos, saving it and copying the link `https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qq0fjs6jvd`.

### $y = sin(x)$ with formating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/usu3h5pyis?embed")
```

To get this use the embed link `https://www.desmos.com/calculator/usu3h5pyis?embed` and the options shown below.

To limit the domain of the function we write. $y = sin(x) \{-2\pi \le x \le 2\pi\}$ which can be obtained by typing `y=sin(x){2pi<=x<=2pi}` into the Desmos graphing calculator.

To streamline the look of the diagram the following options were used.

- large font
- deselect grid
- change x axis limits
- change y axis limits

You can get these by clicking on the spanner in the top right hand corner.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/desmos_options_sin_graph.png")
```

## Showing areas under graphs

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/losncepxjt?embed")
```

The following equations were used to make this.

- $f(x) = x^2 \{ x > 0\}$ by typing `f(x) = x^2 {x > 0}`
- $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ by typing `int f(x) dx` and adding `a` and `b` to the limit boxes and selecting add sliders to all.
- To shade the region under the graph add $0 \le y \le f(x) \{a \le x \le b\}$ by typing `0 <= y <= f(x) {a <= x <= b}`

You can then change the sliders to change the shaded area. Desmos even computes the value of the integral.

This is what the list of equations looks like on Desmos.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

# GeoGebra useful techniques

GeoGebra is a powerful tool. However, expect to invest some time getting to grips with it to make the most out of using it.

See Dalip's notes in the final report.

<!--chapter:end:04-geogebra-useful-techniques.Rmd-->

# The size of the problem

The post-16 maths support community has two large sources of resources that contain inaccessible images; Mathcentre and Helm.

The [mathcentre website](https://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/), now maintained by the [**sigma** network](http://www.sigma-network.ac.uk/), host support materials for anyone looking for post-16 maths help.

[HELM (Help Engineers Learn Maths)](https://github.bath.ac.uk/pages/MASH/HELM/) is a popular resource that has already been converted to HTML. The next stage now is to recreate the images as digital objects.

## Scale of the problem

There are over 1000 images embedded in the mathcentre resources. The HELM resources have about 900 images.  Most will be easy to recreate as a digital object. Some will be tricky here is a flavor of the type of object still to be done.

## Types of image

Fortunately, for the majority of the images in these resources, it is relatively easy to create a digital object. Below is a categorisation of the difficulty of creating these objects with some examples.

### Easy ~5mins

Quickly done in Desmos using one equation and some formatting options.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cubicsfig1.svg")
```

### Medium ~15mins

Can be done in Desmos using more than one equation and formatting options.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/integ92Fig1.svg")
```

### Hard ~?mins

Can only be done in GeoGebra. Will probably require making and then remaking to make an object that is easily navigable.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vectors-scalarprod-fig5.svg")
```

# Useful resources

- It's useful to get an understanding of what your resources are like when *viewed* with a screen reader. Emma Cliffe has made this useful resource to get going: [Getting started with with a simple screen reader](https://people.bath.ac.uk/cspehj/coventry/arclengthInR.html)
- The [accessibility notes for Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/accessibility) are a good place to start.
- The [accessibility notes for Geogebra](https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Accessibility)  are less good but at least they don't take too long to read!
- There are [comprehesive tutorials on learning how to use Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/XUv5mXTm).
- The [Diagram Center's Poet image desccription training site](https://poet.diagramcenter.org/index.html) is useful place to start when thinking about describing images.

# Final Report

*Dalip Bachu*

Understanding the differences between the variance in the difficulties
of recreating the resources shown in the document ['Trigonometric ratios of an angle of any size'](https://mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/mc-ty-trigratiosanysize-2009-1.pdf).

A mock up of the [accessible version of 'Trigonometric ratios of an angle of any size'](https://bathmash.github.io/mathcentre2.0-mockup/) was made using the resources developed over the course of this project.

## Classification of difficulty of conversion.

### Easy: 

![](./Final Report_img/media/image1.png){width="6.268055555555556in" height="2.6631944444444446in"}
This is the original static image of the
sin graph. Recreating this within Desmos is an easy task, as Desmos is
very intuitive. It does not need to look exactly as it does in the
original resource -- the main goal for it is to be accessible. Shown
below is my example resource for the recreated sin.


![](./Final Report_img/media/image3.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.290277777777778in"}

Naming the graph as "graph of sine x" is useful, as the screen reader will read it out literally as it is
spelled. Having as few components as possible on the left-hand side
makes it the most accessible, as there is not too much to output from
the screen reader. Having a \<= sign creates a less than or equal to
sign, this is useful to know. Having the x axis scale in 90 is done by
clicking the spanner in the top right corner and writing 90 in step. An
example of how to do this is shown below.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image2.png){width="1.89375in"
height="2.876388888888889in"}

### Medium:

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/media/image4.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.2381944444444444in"}

![](./Final Report_img/media/image5.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="5.176388888888889in"}
This is an example of one of the resources
that is of medium difficulty to recreate in GeoGebra. As I had no
experience using GeoGebra in the past, I first created this resource
using text to describe each of the edges, rather than using the in-built
captioning feature which is more useful for a visually impaired person.
Also, having each point on the corners visible is more accessible, as it
reads them out as well as the segments between the points. The main
difficulty I found was finding the words to describe a triangle to a
visually impaired person. <https://poet.diagramcenter.org/index.html>
helped, along with reading the text around the image in the page, so I
knew what to include and what has already been said.

### Hard:

The most difficult type of resource I found to make was the dynamic
images of the moving sin, cos and tan graphs. The example of how the tan
graph is in the current pdf is shown below.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image6.png){width="6.200694444444444in"
height="4.618055555555555in"}![Diagram, engineering drawing Description
automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/media/image7.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.7381944444444444in"}
My first attempt to recreate the tan graph and where it is derived from is shown below.

<https://www.geogebra.org/classic/vjwfw2tr>

This was not easily accessible, as there are too many components to
create the graph. They would all be read out one by one. I thought there
was an opportunity to suppress the outputs of some components that
weren't necessary by marking them as auxiliary objects, however the
screen reader reads them from the graphics view rather than the algebra
view. I also thought it would be necessary to show where the x
co-ordinates come from in the tan graph.

We decided that creating the simplest possible resource with the fewest
number of components would be more accessible, as the screen reader
reads each individual component. Also, discovered that you can use two
different graphics views with one algebra view, so you can decide in
which graphics view a point goes. Shown below is the tan graph.

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/media/image8.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.9881944444444444in"}

<https://www.geogebra.org/classic/bnwvnbrc>

## Things I wish I knew before creating the resources:

### Top tips

-   Familiarise yourself with how to describe a mathematical resource
    before you create a resource, using
    <https://poet.diagramcenter.org/>

-   Take the time to understand how to use multiple graphics views in
    GeoGebra before jumping in to create resources.

-   Creating a dynamic resource in GeoGebra is significantly more
    difficult than creating a static image (especially if you're using
    multiple graphics views).

-   Use the minimum number of components when creating a GeoGebra
    resource -- the screen reader will read out every single component
    and there is not a way to suppress the information being read out.

-   Marking things as auxiliary objects does not work -- they hide
    them from the algebra view but when navigating through the
    graphics views they get read out.

-   Use the in-built captioning features to describe an edge or a point
    is more accessible than creating text, as a visually impaired person
    will probably not be able to figure out which text is corresponding
    to which component.

-   Use the captioning to describe certain points to make them more
    accessible.

-   Use the points of an object to create an angle, as using the angle
    between lines feature in GeoGebra is unpredictable.

-   Creating the resources in a certain order is more accessible,
    despite it potentially not being the most logical way to create the
    resource.

-   An example of this will be shown later in the document.

-   It is not always necessary to create a perfect recreation of the
    original image -- a simpler looking but more accessible resource is
    more important than keeping the image exact.

-   Read the text surrounding the image so you know what information is
    vital to put in the resource, and what is not necessary.

-   The workarounds (like creating an arrow with a vector and an arc)
    are not useful for a visually impaired person.

-   If you want to change the order components are read out in -- go in
    construction protocol where you can move things around (be careful
    with dependencies).

-   Use `{}` in Desmos to define where you want the function to start and
    finish.

-   Use `<=` to create the or equal to signs in Desmos.

### Logical vs Accessible:

Since in geogebra the tab order is defined by the order of object
creation sometimes, the most logical way to create a resource is not the
most accessible way to create the resource. An example of this is shown
below.

![Diagram, engineering drawing Description automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/2a3d18c6cfc3b485c17f7b3e774ef51f5a9c12c9.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.1305555555555555in"}

Here is an example of a point P which moves around the circle C. The
most logical way to create this type of resource, I found, was as
follows:

1.  Create point O

2.  Create circle

3.  Create point P

4.  Create point A on the x axis

5.  Create point B on the y axis

6.  Create angle AOP

7.  Create right angle OAP

8.  Create line OA

9.  Create line AP

10. Create line BP

An alternative method to create this resource is the one I used as shown
in the image above:

1.  Create point O on the origin (because of the dependencies this must
    be made first)

2.  Create the circle c centred on the origin having radius 1

3.  Create point P on the diameter of the circle

4.  Create the line segment between points O and P -- this makes it
    clear that the segment is between the origin and the point just
    created.

5.  Create point A which uses the x value of the point P

6.  Create segment AP which uses the point just created

7.  Create segment AO which again uses point A

8.  Create the angles between the segments (OAP and AOP)

9.  Create the final point B (it is hidden here) which uses the y value
    of the point P

10. Create the final segment BP as the point B has just been created.

### Comparing accessibilities between original and simplified tan graphs

I have created two videos of each tan graph, demonstrating how the
screen reader interacts with them. For the initial Tan graph I made, the
screen reader takes approximately 4:30 just to read out each component
of the graph. To interact with the slider, using the screen reader, you
can press the space bar for the angle to change around the origin. It
attempts to read out the angle of the point while it is changing, so
therefore it says "Graphics view 1" over and over until the slider is
paused.

For the simplified (and more accessible tan graph) for the screen reader
to interact with every component, it took 1:10. This is significantly
less than the time it took for the alternative tan graph. I think this
would be easier to understand for a visually impaired person, as there
is a lot less unnecessary information being read out to them. For a
visually impaired person to interact with the point B on this tan graph,
they can use the plus and minus arrows on the keyboard and move through
it in their own time. They could also see where the corresponding point
D is on Graphics View 2 for wherever they place B, and notice the
behaviour of the point D, when B is changed.

The simplified version of each of the Sin, Cos, and Tan graphs I found
to be more accessible, as they made more logical sense to me as I was
experimenting with the screen reader.

### A perfect recreation is not necessary

![](./Final Report_img/media/image10.png){width="3.192361111111111in"
height="2.647222222222222in"}

Initially, I thought it would be best to
create an accessible recreation of the resources that are already made.
This was because I felt that the text surrounding the objects, used to
describe it, would not make sense if the resource isn't an exact match
to what it was before. This caused me to create some workarounds --
which were both not necessary and not accessible. Shown below is how the
original static resource was shown on the document.

Below is my first attempt to make this a dynamic resource.

![A picture containing text, lamp Description automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/media/image11.png){width="3.251023622047244in"
height="2.6692607174103236in"}

I created this and it became a dynamic resource, but I then tested it
with a screen reader, and I discovered that it is not an accessible
resource for a visually impaired person. This is because I used a
workaround in order to get the large arrow around the outside of the
circle. I made it by creating a circular arc around the outside and
attached a very small vector to it. It is made up of two components. The
screen reader reads out each component one at a time, and although the
vector starts from a similar point to where the arc is, they are not
connected so it would be difficult for a visually impaired person to
understand that I was trying to create an arrow.

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](./Final Report_img/media/image12.png){width="2.507919947506562in"
height="2.2376060804899387in"}

This is the final, simplified version of the image. After realising the
arrow wasn't necessary (especially because there is an arrow in the
angle to show which way it is being measured) I decided to get rid of
it. This makes it more accessible to a visually impaired person, as
there is now less components being read out by the screen reader.

## Adding Geogebra to a HTML document

### HTML embed code:

Using the links to transfer across the GeoGebra resources I created
proved to be difficult when embedding them into the accessible HTML
file. A way to overcome this is for the person who created the resource
(me in this case) to tidy it up, by first removing the Algebra view,
followed by resizing both of the graphics views by zooming in or out.
Following this, save the resource into the account of the user and close
it. Then, open GeoGebra's home page and go to the resources page,
followed by clicking "mine" so you can open the resource that you have
just saved. Next, click the three vertical dots in the top right corner
and select details. This will take you to a different page where you can
click share and them embed so you can copy and paste the HTML code.

1.  ![](./Final Report_img/media/image13.png){width="5.84375in"
    height="2.9125in"}Unselect "Algebra" shown below. This will remove
    the left most column where the description of each component is
    shown.

2.  ![](./Final Report_img/media/image14.png){width="5.989583333333333in"
    height="2.9944444444444445in"}If necessary, adjust the zoom levels
    of each of the views separately. This can be done by using the
    scroll wheel or the magnifying glass buttons at the bottom right of
    the views. You can also adjust the positioning of both views here by
    dragging the backgrounds around. The resource should now look like
    this.

3.  Save the resource to your account and close the tab.

4.  Go to geogebra.org and select resources.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image15.png){width="6.418055555555555in"
height="3.111111111111111in"}

5.  ![](./Final Report_img/media/image17.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
    height="3.1041666666666665in"}Select "mine" in the top bar and
    select the resource to open it.

6.  Click the three dots in the top right corner of the page and select
    details

![](./Final Report_img/media/image19.png){width="6.268055555555556in"

    height="3.077777777777778in"}![](./Final Report_img/media/image27.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
    height="3.082638888888889in"}
    Click "share" followed by the "Embed"
    button and copy the code to paste.

8.  To make the applet responsive one method it to use bootstrap
    stylings. Remove the width="1920px" height="961px" and wrap it in a
    div with class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\" so the
    applet can rescale so it can be used on a phone.

### Resizing the GeoGebra file after embedding

It is likely that the GeoGebra "applets" will need resizing once you
have written the code. The easiest way to do this is to resize the
resources on each graphics views and then save it. The code (which will
remain the same) will then access the original resource through GeoGebra
to then display the most recent save of the resource.

### Disabling pan and zoom on GeoGebra applets:

1.  Go to geogebra.org and select "resources" on the left followed by
    "mine" and select the resource you wish to disable the pan and zoom
    feature on.

2.  In the top right, select the three vertical dots button and select
    edit activity.

3.  Then select the pencil icon at the top of the applet, as
    demonstrated by the picture below.

![](./Final Report_img/media/image29.png){width="3.373611111111111in"
height="2.720833333333333in"}

4.  Then scroll down to advanced settings and click the box that says
    enable pan and zoom to unselect it.

5.  ![](./Final Report_img/media/image30.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
    height="2.7729166666666667in"}
    Select save changes and close.

## Desmos:

Desmos is straight forward to use, the documentation is good and it
lends itself to easy diagrams. Here are some tips for using it.

### Defining a function over a range.

In order to define a function over a certain range, use `{}` after the
function. An example is shown below.

![](./Final Report_img/daf27aa683e0fd9dfd50082458801eefc0c513df.png){width="6.260416666666667in"
height="3.120498687664042in"}

### Naming graphs

Name the graph so when it is read out phonetically, the screen reader
will read it out similar to how it is pronounced. The above graph is
named "graph of cosine x" so it will make sense to a visually impaired
person when they are using the screen reader to interact with it.

# Why are we here?

If a picture tells a 1000 words why do we need to add anymore with alt-text? There are two reasons: because we have to and because we should.

## Because we have to

kable(csv_data, caption = "Example of spreadsheet")

# Desmos useful techniques

Here are some useful techniques when using Desmos.

## Removing clutter

By selecting a few options in Desmos you can create really nice looking diagrams.

### $y = sin(x)$ with no formating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qq0fjs6jvd")
```

This is was made by just entering the equation $y = sin(x)$ into Desmos, saving it and copying the link `https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qq0fjs6jvd`.

### $y = sin(x)$ with formating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/usu3h5pyis?embed")
```

To get this use the embed link `https://www.desmos.com/calculator/usu3h5pyis?embed` and the options shown below.

To limit the domain of the function we write. $y = sin(x) \{-2\pi \le x \le 2\pi\}$ which can be obtained by typing `y=sin(x){2pi<=x<=2pi}` into the Desmos graphing calculator.

To streamline the look of the diagram the following options were used.

- large font
- deselect grid
- change x axis limits
- change y axis limits

You can get these by clicking on the spanner in the top right hand corner.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

## Showing areas under graphs

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.desmos.com/calculator/losncepxjt?embed")
```

The following equations were used to make this.

- $f(x) = x^2 \{ x > 0\}$ by typing `f(x) = x^2 {x > 0}`
- $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ by typing `int f(x) dx` and adding `a` and `b` to the limit boxes and selecting add sliders to all.
- To shade the region under the graph add $0 \le y \le f(x) \{a \le x \le b\}$ by typing `0 <= y <= f(x) {a <= x <= b}`

You can then change the sliders to change the shaded area. Desmos even computes the value of the integral.

This is what the list of equations looks like on Desmos.
